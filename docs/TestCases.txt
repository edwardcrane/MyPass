Google Backup API for Backup & Restore
Use the adb shell to send commands to the running app on the mobile device.

on my PC adb is located in C:\Users\ecrane\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools.

To queue up a backup:
    adb shell bmgr backup com.airanza.apass

To run the queued backup requests for all apps now:
    adb shell bmgr run

To run the restore immediately:
    adb shll bmgr restore com.airanza.apass
